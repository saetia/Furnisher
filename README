Too much time is spent trying to get a sense of how a site 
will look and perform with legit data.
Furnisher hopes to give you back all those productive hours you've
wasted dicking around with lorem ipsum.. coming up with fake names,
cropping out placeholders from photoshop comps, browsing for chunks
of text on wikipedia. finding addresses and then torturously geocoding lat long coords.. alright, I'm gonna end up crying if I continue. enjoy!
